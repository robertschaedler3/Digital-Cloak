# Digital "Cloak"
In this project I intend to explore and expose the vulerabilities of WiFi based home security systems.  

##### **Warning**:
This project is for experimental and educational purposes ONLY. It is meant to show vulerabilities in the current WiFi standard. If you intend to use or reproduce the concepts demonstrated in this project, please ensure that you do so on a designated test network or that you have recieved explicit permission from the network owner.

## Overview
Today, many homes are equipped with WiFi based security systems (such as Google's Nest), which you guessed it, use a WiFi connection to "secure" your house. Although these systems are easy to install and use, they have one major flaw: they require a secure internet connection to be operational. Some devices compensate for temporary network outages by storing small amounts of footage during an outage. However after about 5 minutes for most systems, video is no longer stored and security is lost. An attack can be as simple as interferring with the camera's connnection to the internet.
